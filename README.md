## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (DSAI) which focuses on cancer cells. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order.

## Problem Definition
* Are we able to predict whether the characteristic of a cancer cell will be able to predict a malignant or benign tumor?
* Which model would be best to predict it?

## Models Used
* Classification
* Random Forest

## Conclusion
* Concavity, area and concave points are good variables to predict whether a tumour is Benign or Malignant.
* Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing research and collaboration in leveraging data-driven approaches to combat this complex and multifaceted disease.

## What did we learn from this project
* Teamwork makes the dream work
* The use of Random Forest Classifier
* Collaborating on Github
