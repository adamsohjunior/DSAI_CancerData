## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (DSAI) which focuses on cancer cells. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order.

2. [Data Visualisation](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/95cfccf8244e26cf87aa3e0e6d507dcbf342e01a/Notebooks/DataVisualization.ipynb)
3. [Data Splitting/Classification](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/95cfccf8244e26cf87aa3e0e6d507dcbf342e01a/Notebooks/DataSplit_Class.ipynb)
4. [Random Forest Tree](https://github.com/lyxm58290/DSAI_CancerData/blob/95cfccf8244e26cf87aa3e0e6d507dcbf342e01a/Notebooks/RandomForest.ipynb)

## Problem Definition
* Are we able to predict whether the characteristic of a cancer cell will be able to predict a malignant or benign tumor?
* Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used
* Decision Tree Classfier
* Random Forest Classifier (with Cross-Validation)

## Conclusion
* Concavity, area and concave points are good variables to predict whether a tumour is Benign(Good) or Malignant(Bad).
* Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing research and collaboration in leveraging data-driven approaches to combat this complex and multifaceted disease.
* Our model can serve as a valuable tool for initial screening or immediate assessment of tumor malignancy. 

## What did we learn from this project
* Teamwork makes the dream work
* The use of a Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
* Enhance RFC with the Cross-Validation Method
* Collaborating on GitHub
